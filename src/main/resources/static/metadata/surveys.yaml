      text: Oh dear, you seem to be experiencing a PANIC ATTACK. Good news - it's not dangerous at all and you're not gonna die! Adrenaline rushing through your blood makes the heart beat faster, and quick breathing brings elevated levels of oxygen to your brain, which might make you feel dizzy. It's called hyperventilation. You can try to yawn 10 times, or press the Panic! button and take a deep breath. It will pass. Don't worry and try to distract your mind by focusing on some object that you see now. Later, you might want to consider seeing a therapist to discuss how to cope with it in the future. Meanwhile, you can try our friendly journaling bot to start tracking your progress!
